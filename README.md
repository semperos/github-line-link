# Github Line Links

This is a toy project for practicing Rust development. It produces an executable which, when invoked correctly, will print a URL to a file on Github for the latest master commit.

I manually click on the latest commit in Github, then click "Browse files", then find the file and mark the line-numbers while holding <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>, whenever I share files, so that my links are both (semi)permanent and specific.
